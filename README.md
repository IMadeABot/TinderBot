# TinderBot
A simple discord bot which allows for creation of dating profiles and "swiping" through said profiles

I am choosing to remain anonymous and will not be hosting the bot myself.

If you want to host this bot, download the full repo and run get_bot_ready.py

This will prepare the database and ask for the bot's token and the ID of the server and it's verified role. This is to ensure that only people who are supposed to use it can. Once this has run, you should see a success message. Then you are able to run main.py.

Enjoy.
